_It is to be noticed that there is a curious sympathy in point of error
on both sides of the Atlantic, for seventeen of the mistakes quoted in
this book as being made in the Public Schools of America appear in
similar or identical words in an Article on âBoysâ Blundersâ in the_
CORNHILL MAGAZINE _of June, 1886, which was written by a Master in an
English Public School_.

Dr. Blimberâs establishment was a great hothouse in which there was a
forcing apparatus incessantly at work. All the boys blew before their
time. Mental green peas were produced at Christmas and intellectual
asparagus all the year round. Mathematical gooseberries (very sour ones)
were common at untimely seasons and from mere sprouts of bushes under
Dr. Blimberâs cultivation. Every description of Greek and Latin
vegetable was got off the dryest twigs of boys under the frostiest
circumstances. Nature was of no consequence at all. No matter what a
young gentleman was intended to bear Dr. Blimber made him bear to
pattern. But the system of forcing was attended with its usual
disadvantages. There was not the right taste about the premature
productions and they didnât keep well. When poor Paul had spelt out No.
2 he found he had no idea of No. 1, fragments whereof afterwards
obtruded themselves into No. 3 which slided into No. 4 which grafted
itself on to No. 2; so that whether twenty Romuluses made a Remus, or a
verb always agreed with an ancient Briton, or three times four was
Taurus a bull, were open questions with him. But however high and false
the temperature at which Dr. Blimber kept his hothouse, the owners of
the plants were always ready to lend a helping hand at the bellows and
to stir the fire.

_As the greatest compliment that could be paid a writer would be the
assumption that the material contained in this little volume was the
product of that writerâs ingenuity or imagination, it seems needless for
the compiler to state that every line is just what it purports to
be,âbona fide answers to questions asked in the public schools._

_Mark Twain, with his inimitable drollery, comments in the_ CENTURY
MAGAZINE _for April, 1887, upon_ ENGLISH AS SHE IS TAUGHT. _Even this
master of English humor acknowledges his inability to comprehend how
such success in the literature of fun could be attained, not only
without effort or intention, but through heroic struggles to set forth
hard facts and sober statistics. That the English public may have the
benefit of Mark Twainâs comments, his paper is, with his consent, here
reprinted in its complete form. Although this involves a certain amount
of repetitionâcomment and illustration being too intricately blended to
separateâit is a repetition or_ rÃ©sumÃ© _of the best things in the book,
such as the wise reader will hardly grumble at_.

In the appendix to Crokerâs Boswellâs Johnson, one finds this anecdote:


  _Catoâs Soliloquy._âOne day Mrs. Gastrel set a little girl to repeat
  to him [Doctor Samuel Johnson] Catoâs Soliloquy, which she went
  through very correctly. The Doctor, after a pause, asked the childâ

  âWhat was to bring Cato to an end?â

  She said it was a knife.

  âNo, my dear, it was not so.â

  âMy aunt Polly said it was a knife.â

  âWhy, Aunt Pollyâs knife _may do_, but it was a _dagger_, my dear.â

  He then asked her the meaning of âbane and antidote,â which she was
  unable to give. Mrs. Gastrel saidâ

  âYou cannot expect so young a child to know the meaning of such
  words.â

  He then saidâ

  âMy dear, how many pence are there in _sixpence_?â

  âI cannot tell, sir,â was the half-terrified reply.

  On this, addressing himself to Mrs. Gastrel, he saidâ

  âNow, my dear lady, can anything be more ridiculous than to teach a
  child Catoâs Soliloquy, who does not know how many pence there are
  in sixpence?â


In a lecture before the Royal Geographical Society, Professor Ravenstein
quoted the following list of frantic questions, and said that they had
been asked in an examination:


  Mention all the name of places in the world derived from Julius
  CÃ¦sar or Augustus CÃ¦sar.

  Where are the following rivers: Pisuerga, Sakaria, Guadalete, Jalon,
  Mulde?

  All you know of the following: Machacha, Pilmo, Schebulos,
  Crivoscia, Basecs, Mancikert, Taxhen, Citeaux, Meloria, Zutphen.

  The highest peaks of the Karakorum range.

  The number of universities in Prussia.

  Why are the tops of mountains continually covered with snow [_sic_]?

  Name the length and breadth of the streams of lava which issued from
  the Skaptar Jokul in the eruption of 1783.


That list would oversize nearly anybodyâs geographical knowledge. Isnât
it reasonably possible that in our schools many of the questions in all
studies are several miles ahead of where the pupil is?âthat he is set to
struggle with things that are ludicrously beyond his present reach,
hopelessly beyond his present strength? This remark in passing, and by
way of text; now I come to what I was going to say.

I have just now fallen upon a darling literary curiosity. It is a little
book, a manuscript compilation, and the compiler sent it to me with the
request that I say whether I think it ought to be published or not. I
said Yes! but as I slowly grow wise, I briskly grow cautious; and so,
now that the publication is imminent, it has seemed to me that I should
feel more comfortable if I could divide up this responsibility with the
public by adding them to the court. Therefore I will print some extracts
from the book, in the hope that they may make converts to my judgment
that the volume has merit which entitles it to publication.

As to its character. Every one has sampled âEnglish as She has Spokeâ
and âEnglish as She is Wroteâ; this little volume furnishes us an
instructive array of examples of âEnglish as She is Taughtââin the
public schools ofâwell, this country. The collection is made by a
teacher in those schools, and all the examples in it are genuine; none
of them have been tampered with, or doctored in any way. From time to
time, during several years, whenever a pupil has delivered himself of
anything peculiarly quaint or toothsome in the course of his
recitations, this teacher and her associates have privately set that
thing down in a memorandum-book; strictly following the original, as to
grammar, construction, spelling, and all; and the result is this
literary curiosity.

The contents of the book consist mainly of answers given by the boys and
girls to questions, said answers being given sometimes verbally,
sometimes in writing. The subjects touched upon are fifteen in number:
I. Etymology; II. Grammar; III. Mathematics; IV. Geography; V.
âOriginalâ; VI. Analysis; VII. History; VIII. âIntellectualâ; IX.
Philosophy; X. Physiology; XI. Astronomy; XII. Politics; XIII. Music;
XIV. Oratory; XV. Metaphysics.

You perceive that the poor little young idea has taken a shot at a good
many kinds of game in the course of the book. Now as to results. Here
are some quaint definitions of words. It will be noticed that in all of
these instances the sound of the word, or the look of it on paper, has
misled the child:

  _Aborigines_, a system of mountains.

  _Alias_, a good man in the Bible.

  _Amenable_, anything that is mean.

  _Assiduity_, state of being an acid.

  _Auriferous_, pertaining to an orifice.

  _Ammonia_, the food of the gods.

  _Capillary_, a little caterpillar.

  _Corniferous_, rocks in which fossil corn is found.

  _Emolument_, a headstone to a grave.

  _Equestrian_, one who asks questions.

  _Eucharist_, one who plays euchre.

  _Franchise_, anything belonging to the French.

  _Idolater_, a very idol person.

  _Ipecac_, a man who likes a good dinner.

  _Irrigate_, to make fun of.

  _Mendacious_, what can be mended.

  _Mercenary_, one who feels for another.

  _Parasite_, a kind of umbrella.

  _Parasite_, the murder of an infant.

  _Publican_, a man who does his prayers in public.

  _Tenacious_, ten acres of land.

Here is one where the phrase âpublicans and sinnersâ has got mixed up in
the childâs mind with politics, and the result is a definition which
takes one in a sudden and unexpected way:

  _Republican_, a sinner mentioned in the Bible.

Also in Democratic newspapers now and then. Here are two where the
mistake has resulted from sound assisted by remote fact:

  _Plagiarist_, a writer of plays.

  _Demagogue_, a vessel containing beer and other liquids.

I cannot quite make out what it was that misled the pupil in the
following instances; it would not seem to have been the sound of the
word, nor the look of it in print:

  _Asphyxia_, a grumbling, fussy temper.

  _Quarternions_, a bird with a flat beak and no bill, living in New
      Zealand.

  _Quarternions_, the name given to a style of art practised by the
      PhÅnicians.

  _Quarternions_, a religious convention held every hundred years.

  _Sibilant_, the state of being idiotic.

  _Crosier_, a staff carried by the Deity.

In the following sentences the pupilâs ear has been deceiving him again:


  The marriage was illegible.

  He was totally dismasted with the whole performance.

  He enjoys riding on a philosopher.

  She was very quick at repertoire.

  He prayed for the waters to subsidize.

  The leopard is watching his sheep.

  They had a strawberry vestibule.


Here is one whichâwell, now, how often we do slam right into the truth
without ever suspecting it:


  The men employed by the Gas Company go round and speculate the
  meter.


Indeed they do, dear; and when you grow up, many and manyâs the time you
will notice it in the gas bill. In the following sentences the little
people have some information to convey, every time; but in my case they
failed to connect: the light always went out on the keystone word:


  The coercion of some things is remarkable; as bread and molasses.

  Her hat is contiguous because she wears it on one side.

  He preached to an egregious congregation.

  The captain eliminated a bullet through the manâs heart.

  You should take caution and be precarious.

  The supercilious girl acted with vicissitude when the perennial time
  came.


That last is a curiously plausible sentence; one seems to know what it
means, and yet he knows all the time that he doesnât. Here is an odd
(but entirely proper) use of a word, and a most sudden descent from a
lofty philosophical altitude to a very practical and homely
illustration:


  He should endeavour to avoid extremesâlike those of wasps and bees.


And hereâwith âzoÃ¶logicalâ and âgeologicalâ in his mind, but not ready
to his tongueâthe small scholar has innocently gone and let out a couple
of secrets which ought never to have been divulged in any circumstances:


  There are a good many donkeys in theological gardens.

  Some of the best fossils are found in theological cabinets.


Under the head of âGrammarâ the little scholars furnish the following
information:


  Gender is the distinguishing nouns without regard to sex.

  A verb is something to eat.

  Adverbs should always be used as adjectives and adjectives as
  adverbs.

  Every sentence and name of God must begin with a caterpillar.


âCaterpillarâ is well enough, but capital letter would have been
stricter. The following is a brave attempt at a solution, but it failed
to liquify:


  When they are going to say some prose or poetry before they say the
  poetry or prose they must put a semicolon just after the
  introduction of the prose or poetry.


The chapter on âMathematicsâ is full of fruit. From it I take a few
samplesâmainly in an unripe state.


  A straight line is any distance between two places.

  Parallel lines are lines that can never meet until they run
  together.

  A circle is a round straight line with a hole in the middle.

  Things which are equal to each other are equal to anything else.

  To find the number of square feet in a room you multiply the room by
  the number of the feet. The product is the result.


Right you are. In the matter of geography this little book is
unspeakably rich. The questions do not appear to have applied the
microscope to the subject, as did those quoted by Professor Ravenstein;
still they proved plenty difficult enough without that. These pupils did
not hunt with a microscope, they hunted with a shotgun; this is shown by
the crippled condition of the game they brought in:


  America is divided into the Passiffic slope and the Mississippi
  valey.

  North America is separated by Spain.

  America consists from north to south about five hundred miles.

  The United States is quite a small country compared with some other
  countrys, but is about as industrious.

  The capital of the United States is Long Island.

  The five seaports of the U. S. are Newfunlan and Sanfrancisco.

  The principal products of the U. S. is earthquakes and volcanoes.

  The Alaginnies are mountains in Philadelphia.

  The Rocky Mountains are on the western side of Philadelphia.

  Cape Hateras is a vast body, of water surrounded by land and flowing
  into the Gulf of Mexico.

  Mason and Dixonâs line is the Equater.

  One of the leading industries of the United States is mollasses,
  book-covers, numbers, gas, teaching, lumber, manufacturers,
  paper-making, publishers, coal.

  In Austria the principal occupation is gathering Austrich feathers.

  Gibraltar is an island built on a rock.

  Russia is very cold and tyrannical.

  Sicily is one of the Sandwich Islands.

  Hindoostan flows through the Ganges and empties into the
  Mediterranean Sea.

  Ireland is called the Emigrant Isle because it is so beautiful and
  green.

  The width of the different zones Europe lies in depend upon the
  surrounding country.

  The imports of a country are the things that are paid for, the
  exports are the things that are not.

  Climate lasts all the time and weather only a few days.

  The two most famous volcanoes of Europe are Sodom and Gomorrah.


The chapter headed âAnalysisâ shows us that the pupils in our public
schools are not merely loaded up with those showy facts about geography,
mathematics, and so on, and left in that incomplete state; no, thereâs
machinery for clarifying and expanding their minds. They are required to
take poems and analyze them, dig out their common sense, reduce them to
statistics, and reproduce them in a luminous prose translation which
shall tell you at a glance what the poet was trying to get at. One
sample will do. Here is a stanza from âThe Lady of the Lake,â followed
by the pupilâs impressive explanation of it.

               Alone, but with unbated zeal,
               The horseman plied with scourge and steel;
               For jaded now and spent with toil,
               Embossed with foam and dark with soil,
               While every gasp with sobs he drew,
               The laboring stag strained full in view.


  The man who rode on the horse performed the whip and an instrument
  made of steel alone with strong ardor not diminishing, for, being
  tired from the time passed with hard labor overworked with anger and
  ignorant with weariness, while every breath for labor he drew with
  cries full of sorrow, the young deer made imperfect who worked hard
  filtered in sight.


I see, now, that I never understood that poem before. I have had
glimpses of its meaning, in moments when I was not as ignorant with
weariness as usual, but this is the first time the whole spacious idea
of it ever filtered in sight. If I were a public-school pupil I would
put those other studies aside and stick to analysis; for, after all, it
is the thing to spread your mind.

We come now to historical matters, historical remains, one might say. As
one turns the pages, he is impressed with the depth to which one date
has been driven into the American childâs headâ1492. The date is there,
and it is there to stay. And it is always at hand, always deliverable at
a momentâs notice. But the Fact that belongs with it? That is quite
another matter. Only the date itself is familiar and sure: its vast Fact
has failed of lodgment. It would appear that whenever you ask a
public-school pupil when a thingâanything, no matter whatâhappened, and
he is in doubt, he always rips out his 1492. He applies it to
everything, from the landing of the ark to the introduction of the
horse-car. Well, after all, it is our first date, and so it is right
enough to honor it, and pay the public schools to teach our children to
honor it:


  George Washington was born in 1492.

  Washington wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1492.

  St. Bartholemew was massacred in 1492.

  The Brittains were the Saxons who entered England in 1492 under
  Julius CÃ¦sar.

  The earth is 1492 miles in circumference.


To proceed with âHistoryâ:


  Christopher Columbus was called the father of his Country.

  Queen Isabella of Spain sold her watch and chain and other millinery
  so that Columbus could discover America.

  The Indian wars were very desecrating to the country.

  The Indians pursued their warfare by hiding in the bushes and then
  scalping them.

  Captain John Smith has been styled the father of his country. His
  life was saved by his daughter Pochahantas.

  The Puritans found an insane asylum in the wilds of America.

  The Stamp Act was to make everybody stamp all materials so they
  should be null and void.

  Washington died in Spain almost brokenhearted. His remains were
  taken to the cathedral in Havana.

  Gorilla warfare was where men rode on gorillas.

  John Brown was a very good insane man who tried to get fugitives
  slaves into Virginia. He captured all the inhabitants, but was
  finally conquered and condemned to his death. The Confederasy was
  formed by the fugitive slaves.

  Alfred the Great reigned 872 years. He was distinguished for letting
  some buckwheat cakes burn, and the lady scolded him.

  Henry Eight was famous for being a great widower haveing lost
  several wives.

  Lady Jane Grey studied Greek and Latin and was beheaded after a few
  days.

  John Bright is noted for an incurable disease.

  Lord James Gordon Bennett instigated the Gordon Riots.

  The Middle Ages come in between antiquity and posterity.

  Luther introduced Christianity into England a good many thousand
  years ago. His birthday was November 1883. He was once a Pope. He
  lived at the time of the Rebellion of Worms.

  Julius CÃ¦sar is noted for his famous telegram dispatch I came I saw
  I conquered.

  Julius CÃ¦sar was really a very great man. He was a very great
  soldier and wrote a book for beginners in the Latin.

  Cleopatra was caused by the death of an asp which she dissolved in a
  wine cup.

  The only form of government in Greece was a limited monkey.

  The Persian war lasted about 500 years.

  Greece had only 7 wise men.

  Socrates ... destroyed some statues and had to drink Shamrock.


Here is a fact correctly stated; and yet it is phrased with such
ingenious infelicity that it can be depended upon to convey
misinformation every time it is uncarefully read:


  By the Salic law no woman or descendant of a woman could occupy the
  throne.


To show how far a child can travel in history with judicious and
diligent boosting in the public school, we select the following mosaic:


  Abraham Lincoln was born in Wales in 1599.


In the chapter headed âIntellectualâ I find a great number of most
interesting statements. A sample or two may be found not amiss:


  Bracebridge Hall was written by Henry Irving.

  Snow Bound was written by Peter Cooper.

  The House of the Seven Gables, was written by Lord Bryant.

  Edgar A. Poe was a very curdling writer.

  Cotton Mather was a writer who invented the cotten gin and wrote
  histories.

  Beowulf wrote the Scriptures.

In the middle of the chapter I find many pages of information concerning
Shakspereâs plays, Miltonâs works, and those of Bacon, Addison, Samuel
Johnson, Fielding, Richardson, Sterne, Smollett, De Foe, Locke, Pope,
Swift, Goldsmith, Burns, Cowper, Wordsworth, Gibbon, Byron, Coleridge,
Hood, Scott, Macaulay, George Eliot, Dickens, Bulwer, Thackeray,
Browning, Mrs. Browning, Tennyson, and Disraeliâa fact which shows that
into the restricted stomach of the public-school pupil is shoveled every
year the blood, bone, and viscera of a gigantic literature, and the same
is there digested and disposed of in a most successful and
characteristic and gratifying public-school way. I have space for but a
trifling few of the results:


  Lord Byron was the son of an heiress and a drunken man.

  Wm. Wordsworth wrote the Barefoot Boy and Imitations on Immortality.

  Gibbon wrote a history of his travels in Italy. This was original.

  George Eliot left a wife and children who mourned greatly for his
  genius.

  George Eliot Miss Mary Evans Mrs. Cross Mrs. Lewis was the greatest
  female poet unless George Sands is made an exception of.

  Bulwell is considered a good writer.

  Sir Walter Scott Charles Bronte Alfred the Great and Johnson were
  the first great novelists.

  Thomas Babington Makorlay graduated at Harvard and then studied law,
  he was raised to the peerage as baron in 1557 and died in 1776.


Here are two or three miscellaneous facts that may be of value, if taken
in moderation:


  Homerâs writings are Homerâs Essays Virgil the Aneid and Paradise
  lost some people say that these poems were not written by Homer but
  by another man of the same name.

  A sort of sadness kind of shone in Bryantâs poems.

  Holmes is a very profligate and amusing writer.


When the public-school pupil wrestles with the political features of the
Great Republic, they throw him sometimes:


  A bill becomes a law when the president vetos it.

  The three departments of the government is the President rules the
  world, the governor rules the State, the mayor rules the city.

  The first conscientious Congress met in Philadelphia.

  The Contitution of the United States was established to ensure
  domestic hostility.


Truth crushed to earth will rise again. As follows:


  The Constitution of the United States is that part of the book at
  the end which nobody reads.


And here she rises once more and untimely. There should be a limit to
public-school instruction; it cannot be wise or well to let the young
find out everything:


  Congress is divided into civilized half civilized and savage.


Here are some results of study in music and oratory:


  An interval in music is the distance on the keyboard from one piano
  to the next.

  A rest means you are not to sing it.

  Emphasis is putting more distress on one word than another.


The chapter on âPhysiologyâ contains much that ought not to be lost to
science:


  Physillogigy is to study about your bones stummick and vertebry.

  Occupations which are injurious to health are carbolic acid gas
  which is impure blood.

  We have an upper and a lower skin. The lower skin moves all the time
  and the upper skin moves when we do.

  The body is mostly composed of water and about one half is
  avaricious tissue.

  The stomach is a small pear-shaped bone situated in the body.

  The gastric juice keeps the bones from creaking.

  The Chyle flows up the middle of the backbone and reaches the heart
  where it meets the oxygen and is purified.

  The salivary glands are used to salivate the body.

  In the stomach starch is changed to cane sugar and cane sugar to
  sugar cane.

  The olfactory nerve enters the cavity of the orbit and is developed
  into the special sense of hearing.

  The growth of a tooth begins in the back of the mouth and extends to
  the stomach.

  If we were on a railroad track and a train was coming the train
  would deafen our ears so that we couldnât see to get off the track.


If, up to this point, none of my quotations have added flavour to the
Johnsonian anecdote at the head of this article, let us make another
attempt:


  The theory that intuitive truths are discovered by the light of
  nature originated from St. Johnâs interpretation of a passage in the
  Gospel of Plato.

  The weight of the earth is found by comparing a mass of known lead
  with that of a mass of unknown lead.

  To find the weight of the earth take the length of a degree on a
  meridian and multiply by 62Â½ pounds.

  The spheres are to each other as the squares of their homologous
  sides.

  A body will go just as far in the first second as the body will go
  plus the force of gravity and thatâs equal to twice what the body
  will go.

  Specific gravity is the weight to be compared weight of an equal
  volume of or that is the weight of a body compared with the weight
  of an equal volume.

  The law of fluid pressure divide the different forms of organized
  bodies by the form of attraction and the number increased will be
  the form.

  Inertia is that proberty of bodies by virtue of which it cannot
  change its own condition of rest or motion. In other words it is the
  negative quality of passiveness either in recoverable latency or
  insipient latescence.


If a laugh is fair here, not the struggling child, but the unintelligent
teacherâor rather the unintelligent Boards, Committees, and Trusteesâare
the proper target for it. All through this little book one detects the
signs of a certain probable factâthat a large part of the pupilâs
âinstructionâ consists in cramming him with obscure and wordy ârulesâ
which he does not understand, and has no time to understand. It would be
as useful to cram him with brickbats; they would at least stay. In a
town in the interior of New York, a few years ago, a gentleman set forth
a mathematical problem and proposed to give a prize to every
public-school pupil who should furnish the correct solution of it.
Twenty-two of the brightest boys in the public schools entered the
contest. The problem was not a very difficult one for pupils of their
mathematical rank and standing, yet they all failedâby a hairâthrough
one trifling mistake or another. Some searching questions were asked,
when it turned out that these lads were as glib as parrots with the
ârulesâ but could not reason out a single rule or explain the principle
underlying it. Their memories had been stocked, but not their
understandings. It was a case of brickbat culture, pure and simple.

There are several curious âcompositionsâ in the little book, and we must
make room for one. It is full of naÃ¯vetÃ©, brutal truth, and
unembarrassed directness, and is the funniest (genuine) boyâs
composition I think I have ever seen:


                               ON GIRLS.

  Girls are very stuckup and dignified in their manner and be have
  your. They think more of dress than anything and like to play with
  dowls and rags. They cry if they see a cow in a far distance and are
  afraid of guns. They stay at home all the time and go to church on
  Sunday. They are al-ways sick. They are al-ways funy and making fun
  of boyâs hands and they say how dirty. They cant play marbles. I
  pity them poor things. They make fun of boys and then turn round and
  love them. I donât beleave they ever killed a cat or anything. They
  look out every nite and say oh ant the moon lovely. Thir is one
  thing I have not told and that is they al-ways now their lessons
  bettern boys.


From Mr. Edward Channingâs recent article in âScienceâ:


  The marked difference between the books now being produced by
  French, English, and American travellers, on the one hand, and
  German explorers on the other, is too great to escape attention.
  That difference is due entirely to the fact that in school and
  university the German is taught, in the first place to see, and in
  the second place to understand what he does see.

calf-skin.


                             _On Laughter._

Laughter is something I know everybody can do. Some people laugh until
the tears come from their eyes and then they have a crying spell and
then when that is over they have a laughing spell. When people cry it
will make them look very peculiar so most of people very seldom cry. It
is the laughing they generally do.


                            _On Occupation._

I think if I should become a shoe manufacturer I should succeed as it is
a very profitable occupation and shoes are necessary to all classes and
consequently a large trade is a general thing.

                          _George Washington._

George Washington was the first president of the United States born in
Virginia in the year. When George was a little boy he would never tell a
lie. Because he thought it was not nice. It tis not nice nether. He
studied all kinds of things to be a president.

railroad and a man by the name of Guitue came behind and shot him. Then

him on the railroad.


                             _On Reading._

Reading makes us intelligent; and learn about things we would otherwise
hear nothing.

It is pleasant to recapitulate stories to persons who probably have not
had the opportunity of reading them and it therefore passes many a
dreary hour away and makes many a person renew his happiness by hoping
for such a favorable end as some characters as are described in the
book.

                                   â

If we did not have the capacity of reading we might wait all our lives
and never secure the desired information, but if instead of waiting for
some one to tell us we take the book or paper or whatever it might
happen to be and read it for ourselves we will be much better satisfied
and also have the consolation of knowing we discovered it for ourselves
and did not have to wait for other people to come and furnish us with
the desired information.

                                   â

In reading there is a large amount of knowledge attained for it enlarged
the mind while reading and continues until we pass away.

When we read we come across words that when we hear them spoken of we
are entirely ignorant of them.

                                   â

The untutored mind is often surprisingly expanded in reading for only a
short while a little every day. Then when we hear certain subjects
spoken of we do not wonder what it all means.

                                   â

Reading the talents of others helps us to compose something that may
help us in future life. Without reading we should not know any thing
about our forefathers or how we came to be civilized. What would we know
about religion if we did not read our Bible and find out how religion
originated?


                              _On Girls._

Girls are very stuckup and dignefied in their maner and behaveyour. They
think more of dress than any thing and like to play with dowls and rags.
They cry if they see a cow in afar distance and are afraid of guns. They
stay at home all the time and go to Church every Sunday. They are
al-ways sick. They are al-ways funy and making fun of boys hands and
they say how dirty. They cant play marbels. I pity them poor things.
They make fun of boys and then turn round and love them. I dont beleave
they ever kiled a cat or any thing. They look out every nite and say oh
ant the moon lovely. Thir is one thing I have not told and that is they
always now their lessons bettern boys.


                        _On Timidity of Women._

Timidity is a disease very prevelent among our American women. It is
thought by them to be an ornament to their charms.

How many young women faint by the sudden appearance of a rat from its
hideing place. Oh! they do declare itâs impossible to live where these
dreadful creatures make their homes they ask Ma cant she and wont she
please to try to secure some remedy so they can be destroyed. You will
see the young ladies leap up over stones and steps of great height so as
to escape the barks of the dog, if they are walking with a friend of the
male kind they will cling to the masculine arm and beseach him to walk
so that she might loose sight of that horrible creature known as a dog.

I do think their cases of timidity that cannot be governed such as cases
of intemperance fighting and death. We dont want to see any man come
along the street destitute of reasoning and come reeling suddenly by
you. Also the expectation of death when we see a loved sister going away
from a cherished circle.

It cannot be endured, but I have no objections for these cases but the
preceding ones are ridiculous and I beseach you to reject it remembering
you shall have to undergo greater trials than those related.


                             _On Poverty._

How many persons possess it! They are persons whose poverty cannot be
endured they had enjoyed preceding years in wealth and by some mishap in
the family they became poor and how can they endeavor to forget that
time when their happiness could not be expressed but now their troubles
shall be discovered.

Poverty is a case that cannot be hidden it must be let known so that the
possessors may obtain condolence in some way. Places for poor persons
are not of much importance for the care of them is not worth mentioning.

Some poor persons with a great deal of poverty would rather walk from
house to house in search of some nourishment than inhabit those
institutions but what a number of times they are driven from the door
with the contemptuousness of the rich how many slang words are said to
them.

If our comfortable friends should remember those persons casting away
food raiment and apparel they would be less cases of poverty and when
sickness overtakes such persons lend a helping hand their consciences
would less smite them.


                            _On Politeness._

Politeness is to say and do the kindest way. I think it is easier for
girls to be polite than for boys, but I am not sure as I have never been
a girl. Politeness is used in all parts of the United States.


                        _On the Play of Hamlet._

Hamlet was a young man very nervous. He was always dressed in black
because his uncle had killed his father by shooting him in his ear. He
could not go to the theatre because his father was dead so he had the
actors come to his house and play in the front parlor and he learned
them to say the words because he thought he knew best how to say them.
And then he thought heâd kill the king but he didnât. Hamlet liked
Ophelia. He thought she was a very nice girl but he didnât marry her
because she was going to be a nunnery. Hamlet went to England but he did
not like it very much so he came home. Then he jumped into Opheliaâs
grave and fought a duel with her brother. Then he died.

                                   â

Hamlet was exceedingly sensitiveness. He denunciated his mother because
she entered the matrimonial condition and showed her two photographs
which he said one was Hesperus and one a satire. He made her experience
great regret. He was engaged to Orphelia but had to neglect her as he
was obliged to give his attentions to revenging his fatherâs death. His
uncle was the murderer of his father, Hamletâs father. He had a very
mournful existence and was a great philosopher.

                     For the soul is dead that slumbers,
                       And things are not what they seem.
             _Psalm of Life._  HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.

The way we pass a lifetime is to us but as if we were asleep and we do
not remember all that happens but the happy moments. When we are dead
then we see what we have done in a different way.

                                   â

Donât say life is only an empty dream. If our souls stop living and go
to sleep it cannot be so for we would die. The last thing we are to
attain to I think is the grave.

                                   â

Your the same as dead when your asleep and things that are making you
pleasant now will one day make you sorry.

                                   â

Do not tell me that life is a dream, because when I sleep things will
not be like I think they are.

                                   â

This means that you know without being told in rymes, that life and soul
shall die away and be nothing.

                                   â

Donât tell me in sorrowful verses life is only an illusion, the soul is
wicked that slumbers, and things are very deceitful.

             The heights by great men reached and kept
               Were not attained by sudden flight;
             But they while their companions slept
               Were toiling upwards in the night.
           _The Ladder of St. Augustine._  H. W. LONGFELLOW.

Great men have not made flights very suddenly. They have slept with
their companions while they were toiling to keep the heights they had
attained.

                                   â

The heights that great men have kept out of reach were not attained by
means of sudden flight. While their companions were sleeping they were
up at all hours of the toiling night.

  In the lexicon of Youth, which fate reserves for a bright manhood,
  thereâs no such word as Fail.

                                   _Richelieu._  EDWARD BULWER LYTTON.


In the early days of youth which destiny waits for a better chance,
there is no such word as fail.

                                   â

The lexicon of youth which is fated for a bright manhood, should never
fail.

                                   â

The sentence means, in the beginning of youth the fate that is kept for
a bright manhood must not be a failure.

                                   â

There was no such word as fail when I was a boy, but now I am a man.

                                   â

If you study while you are young your knowledge will be preserved and
you can not fail.

                                   â

The word fail never appears in the natural teachings of youth and is
kept for bright manhood.

                                   â

             Alone, but with unbated zeal,
             The horseman plied with scourge and steel;
             For jaded now and spent with toil,
             Embossed with foam and dark with soil,
             While every gasp with sobs he drew,
             The laboring stag strained full in view.
                 _The Lady of the Lake._  SIR WALTER SCOTT.

The man who rode on the horse performed the whip and an instrument made
of steel alone with strong ardor not diminishing, for, being tired from
the time passed with hard labor overworked with anger and ignorant with
weariness, while every breath for labor he drew with cries full of
sorrow, the young deer made imperfect who worked hard filtered in sight.

             To him who in the love of nature holds

             She has a smile and eloquence of beauty,
             And she steals into his darker musings
             With a mild and gentle sympathy that steals
             Away their sharpness ere he is aware.
                         _Thanatopsis._  WM. CULLEN BRYANT.

feeling that steals away their sharpness before he is aware of it.

                       Two angels guide
           The path of man, both aged and yet young,
           As angels are, ripening through endless years.
           On one he leans: some call her Memory,
           And some, Tradition; and her voice is sweet
           With deep mysterious accords: the other,
           Floating above, holds down a lamp which streams
           A light divine and searching on the earth,
           Compelling eyes and footsteps. Memory yields,
           Yet clings with loving cheek, and shines anew
           Reflecting all the rays of that bright lamp
           Our angel Reason holds. We had not walked
           But for Tradition; we walk evermore
           To higher paths, by brightening Reasonâs lamp.
                         _The Spanish Gypsy._  GEORGE ELIOT.

Was it not for Tradition we would not travel this far. We are still
walking to brighter steps by shining our brains. What little intellect
we have, if it was well shined, it might do a great deal.

                                   â

Man is guided by two spirits, evil and good, and if the evil spirit
(before he was a good one) had been a good one, man would not have been
created.

                                   â

Manâs path guides two angels. One is old and one is young. Ones names
Memory and one is Tradition. One floats round and hunts for things on
the earth. Memory clings to the cheek and shines the lamp that Reason
holds. Tradition helps us to walk and we brighten up Reasonâs lamp.

                                   â

Two great Powers or Forces guide men and women in this world whether
they be young or old, and these powers are still growing through numbers
of years.

                                   â

We lean on Mearcy and Tradition. But whatere it may be, the sound is
sweet with vast mysterious accords. Then Power or Mearcy glares above
us, and there looks down upon us with extreme splendor.

                                   â

Memory still shines reflecting that light our senses tell us of, or that
is within our brains, if we have any. And I suppose we are all gifted
with a little.

                                   â

Had an angel never committed sin, we never would have been created and
guarded by a heavenly spirit.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
